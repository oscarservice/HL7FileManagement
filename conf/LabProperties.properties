# OSCAR LAB PROPERTIES
#
# Make sure to specify the full path of the locations
#
#       for linux.... THE ROOT DIRECTORY IS ASSUMED AND THE LEADING '/' IS NOT ALLOWED
#               ie/             incomingHL7dir1 = home/username/messages/incomingHL7dir
#
#       for windows.... YOU MUST USE THE UNIX STYLE '/' INSTEAD OF THE WINDOWS STYLE '\'
#               ie/             incomingHL7dir1 = c:/messages/incomingHL7dir
#                                                               instead of 'c:\messages\incomingHL7dir'
#
# If you wish to use multiple message formats such as CML and MDS you must specify a seperate
# incoming directory for each format, and the locations of the different keys for each format.
# You can use up to 3 different formats. If you are not using multiple formats or you are only
# using 2 formats then leave the extra incomingHL7dir(s) and the extra keyLocation(s) blank.
#
# The smtpServer, senderEmailAddress and recipientEmailAddress must be specified in order to
# recieve an email when there is an error uploading a file.
